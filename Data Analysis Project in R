## Making Education Dummy Variables
```{r}
#I need to create these in order to have an individuals education level
#same for education
prop.table(table(cps_data$educ))
val_lab(cps_data$educ) = num_lab("
                          1 LTHS
                          2 HS
                          3 Some College
                          4 College
                          5 Advanced
                          ")

prop.table(table(cps_data$educ))

cps_data <- transform(cps_data,
  lths = ifelse(cps_data$educ == 1, 1, 0),
  hs = ifelse(cps_data$educ == 2, 1, 0),
  somecol = ifelse(cps_data$educ == 3, 1, 0),
  college = ifelse(cps_data$educ == 4, 1, 0),
  advanced = ifelse(cps_data$educ == 5, 1, 0)
)

```


## Question 2: Constructing Dummy Variables
```{r}
#These variables are being created in order to see an individuals employment status

prop.table(table(cps_data$lfstat))

val_lab(cps_data$lfstat) = num_lab("
                          1 Employed
                          2 Unemployed
                          3 NILF
                          ")

prop.table(table(cps_data$lfstat))

cps_data <- transform(cps_data,
  empl_test = ifelse(cps_data$lfstat == 1, 1, 0),
  unemp_test = ifelse(cps_data$lfstat == 2, 1, 0),
  nilf_test = ifelse(cps_data$lfstat == 3, 1, 0)
)
#Now I will show that the dummy variables are mutually exclusive by showing that the mean of these is summed to 1
summary(cps_data$empl_test)

summary(cps_data$unemp_test)

summary(cps_data$nilf_test)

prop.table(table(cps_data$lfstat))

total = mean(cps_data$empl_test, na.rm = TRUE) + mean(cps_data$unemp_test, na.rm = TRUE) + mean(cps_data$nilf_test, na.rm = TRUE)

total
```

As it can be seen, the means perfectly add up to 1, making them mutually exclusive.

## Question 3
```{r}
#The correlation between rw and state
cor_test <- cor.test(cps_data$rw, cps_data$state)
cor_test

#The correlation between rw and age
cor_test1 <-cor.test(cps_data$rw, cps_data$age)
cor_test1

#The correlation between rw and college
cor_test2 <-cor.test(cps_data$rw, cps_data$college)
cor_test2

#The correlation between rw and sex
cor_test3 <-cor.test(cps_data$rw, cps_data$female)
cor_test3

#The correlation between rw and metro
cor_test4 <-cor.test(cps_data$rw, cps_data$metro)
cor_test4
```

## Produce Summary Statistics
```{r}
#Summary of rw
summary(cps_data$rw)

#Summary of state
summary(cps_data$state)

#Summary of age
summary(cps_data$age)

#Summary of college
summary(cps_data$college)

#Summary of female
summary(cps_data$female)

#Summary of metro
summary(cps_data$metro)
```

## Question 4

Next, we will perform a regression analysis using the following equation:

$$
wage_i= \beta_0 + \beta_1State_i + \beta_2Age_i + \beta_3College_i + \beta_4Female_i + \beta_5Metro_i +  u_i
$$
Before we factor in any specifications, let us just look at the broad model.
```{r}
modell <- lm(log(rw) ~ state + age + college + female + metro, data=cps_data)
summary(modell)
```

Before we factor in specific locations, Let us first look an individual who has a college degree and just presumably graduated.
```{r}
model <- lm(log(rw) ~ state + age + college + female + metro, data=cps_data, 
             subset=(college == 1 & (age>22 & age < 25)))
summary(model)
```

Now, let us look at individual with the same stipulations as above but also lives in Texas.
```{r}
model2 <- lm(log(rw) ~ state + age + college + female + metro, data=cps_data, 
             subset=(college == 1 & (age>22 & age < 25) & state == 74))
summary(model2)
```

Now, we will look at the same individual from model two except they now also live in Colorado. 

```{r}
model3 <- lm(log(rw) ~ state + age + college + female + metro, data=cps_data, 
             subset=(college == 1 & (age>22 & age < 25) & state == 84))
summary(model3)
```
